The itsy bitsy spider
went up the water spout.
Down came the rain,
and washed the spider out.
Out came the sun,
and dried up all the rain.
So, the itsy bitsy spider
went up the spout again.

Make it rain

This is a lovely story

It Pushes, It Pulls, Commiting is it's thing.
Incy prefers Git over subversion, as it is the main one!
