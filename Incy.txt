Itsy Bitsy spider
Climbed up the water spout
He was a really good hider 
It gave him lots of clout
Along came the breeze and blew the spider out
code flows like rivers through the night
A dance of logic clean and clear
each function shines with hidden might
its purpose sharps, its edges near
The sun descends, a fiery ball,
A gentle breeze begins to sigh,
Shadows lengthen, covering all,
As dusk paints colours in the sky,
The day is done, beyond recall,
And peace descends as night draws nigh.
I have made a severe and continuous lapse in my judgement
With a steady rhythm, eight legs danced about.
Through mist and drizzle, he spun hope inside doubt.
A gentle breeze begins to blow,
Whispering secrets, soft and low.
The moon ascends, a silver gleam,
Lost in a peaceful, waking dream.
