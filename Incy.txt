Itsy Bitsy spider
Climbed up the water spout
Beneath the moon, the forest sleeps,
Its secrets held in silent song.
The stars above, a watch they keep,
Their shimmer steady all night long.
The wind moves soft through branches high,
While dreams drift gently through the sky.

The sun descends, a fiery ball,
A gentle breeze begins to sigh,
Shadows lengthen, covering all,
As dusk paints colours in the sky,
The day is done, beyond recall,
And peace descends as night draws nigh.
I have made a severe and continuous lapse in my judgement

A gentle breeze begins to blow,
Whispering secrets, soft and low.
The moon ascends, a silver gleam,
Lost in a peaceful, waking dream.
