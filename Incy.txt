Incy Wincy spider
Climbed up the water spout
Down came the rain
And washed poor Incy out

 Out came the sunshine

and dried up all the rain

Climbed up the spout again 

Repeat until everyone is sick of song

That was a bit silly of him
to go all the way out on a limb
just to experience the pain
of being washed away again
