[Intro: Bubbler Ranx]
Baby girl, I said tonight is your lucky night
Peter Andre along wid Bubbla Ranks on de mic

[Verse 1: Peter Andre]
I stop and stare at you
Walking on the shore
I try to concentrate
My mind wants to explore
The tropical scent of you
Pick's me up above
And girl when I look at you
Oh I fall in love


[Pre-Chorus: Peter Andre]
And no doubt you look so fine
And girl I wanna make you mine
I want to be with a woman just like you
And no doubt I'm the only man
Who can love you like I can
So just let me be with the woman that I love

[Bridge: Bubbler Ranx]
Baby girl, shine like a looking glass!

[Chorus: Peter Andre]
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Mysterious girl
I wanna get close to you
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Mysterious girl
Move your body close to mine

[Verse 2: Bubbler Ranx]
Girl you are me heart's desire
And you alone a set me soul on fire
Me tell dem
Girl you are me heart's desire
And you alone - watch dis

[Verse 3: Peter Andre]
Watching the sun go down
The tide is drifting in
We can get closer now
And feel the warmth within
Cause I'm looking in your eyes
Feeling so alive
And girl when you touch me
It's time to take it through the night

[Pre-Chorus 2: Peter Andre]
Girl I wanna be with you
I wanna spend the night with you
I need to be with the woman that I love
And girl I wanna do to you
All the things you want me to
I need to be with the woman that I love

[Bridge 2: Bubbler Ranx]
Baby girl, let your love release!

[Chorus: Peter Andre]

[Verse 4: Bubbler Ranx]
Well I've been sitting by the phone hoping you'd call
When time me hear your voice I feel ten feet tall
Body weh you have a make de man dem a bawl
Man a trip over man when time your name call
Your pretty looks surround me like a flowers a bloom
And I love the smell of your Elizabeth Taylor perfume
Your personality alone light up de room
Just one kiss alone a make me heart go boom
