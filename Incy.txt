Itsy Bitsy spider
Climbed up the water spout
Hey diddle diddle the cat and the fiddle
Itsy Bitsy spider
Climbed up the water spout
Along came the breeze and blew the spider out
code flows like rivers through the night
A dance of logic clean and clear
each function shines with hidden might
its purpose sharps, its edges near

The sun descends, a fiery ball,
A gentle breeze begins to sigh,
Shadows lengthen, covering all,
As dusk paints colours in the sky,
The day is done, beyond recall,
And peace descends as night draws nigh.
