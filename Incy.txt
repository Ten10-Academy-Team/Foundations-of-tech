Incy wincy spider
Climbed up the water spout
Tried to get a skin fade
After growing their hair out
Out went Incy to the barber shop
The barber said "what a cut!" and let out a pleased shout
Their fashion choice in clothing needed to be re-made
After Incy Wincy Spider got that low-taper fade
- "Low Taper Fade", by ProfessionalDragon

Other poems go here:

Ubzi was here
And I dont like to shout

No the incy wincy spider doesn't
climb the water sprout

It climbed my table and scared the living daylights out!
He decided he didn't like swimming
And then he wanted out :(
