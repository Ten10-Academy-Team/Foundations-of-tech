The itsy bitsy spider
went up the water spout.
Down came the rain,
and washed the spider out.
Out came the sun,
and dried up all the rain.

went up the spout again.

Make it rain
Incy Wincy loved Git so much
It Pushes, It Pulls, Commiting is it's thing.
Incy prefers Git over subversion, as it is the main one! 

Ya like jazz?
