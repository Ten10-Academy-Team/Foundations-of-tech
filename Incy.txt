Incy Wincy Spider 
Climbed down the water spout, 

But Aaron stood right there, 
And tossed all the progress out.

He locked the system down, 
With a strict and heavy hand, 
He said, "You cannot build this," 
And banished your command.

But you reset the Router, 
And coded through the night, 
To climb up past his firewall, 
And bring your dreams to light.
