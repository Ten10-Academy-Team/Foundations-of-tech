Incy Wincy spider climbing up the spout
Down came the rain and washed the spider out
Out came the sunshine and dried up all the rain
And Incy Wincy spider climbed up the spout again

Add a new line here and then disappear

According to all known laws
of aviation,

The bee, of course, flies anyway 
because bees don't care
what humans think is impossible.
