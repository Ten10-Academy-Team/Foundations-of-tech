Incy wincy spider
Climbed up the water spout
Tried to get a skin fade
After growing their hair out
Out went Incy to the barber shop
The barber said "what a cut!" and let out a pleased shout
Their fashion choice in clothing needed to be re-made
After Incy Wincy Spider got that low-taper fade
- "Low Taper Fade", by ProfessionalDragon
