Please be upstanding for our national anthem:

Everyday when you're walking down the street
And everybody that you meet
Has an original point of view

And I say HEY! (HEY!)
What a wonderful kind of day.
If you can learn to work and play
And get along with each other

You got to listen to your heart
Listen to the beat
Listen to the rhythm
The rhythm of the street
Open up your eyes
Open up your ears
Get together and make things better
By working together!

It's a simple message and it comes from the heart
Believe in yourself (in yourself)
cause that's the place to start (to start)

And I say HEY! (HEY!)
What a wonderful kind of day
If we can learn to work and play
And get along with each other.
Hey what a wonderful kind of day hey!
Hey what a wonderful kind of day hey!
