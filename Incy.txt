an itsy bitsy spider
down came the rain And
washed the spider out
How could AK walk in the rain?
an itsy bitsy spider never had 
the same fun again...

 
=======

Itsy Bitsy spider
Climbed up the water spout
Along came the breeze and blew the spider out
code flows like rivers through the night
A dance of logic clean and clear
each function shines with hidden might
its purpose sharps, its edges near
The sun descends, a fiery ball,
A gentle breeze begins to sigh,
Shadows lengthen, covering all,
As dusk paints colours in the sky,
The day is done, beyond recall,
And peace descends as night draws nigh.
