INT. ROSE'S SUITE 103
... 1912. Like in a dream the beautiful woodwork and satin
upholstery emerge from the rusted ruin. Jack is overwhelmed
by the opulence of the room. He sets his sketchbood and
drawing materials on the marble table.
ROSE
Will this light do? Don't artists
need good light?
JACK
(bad French accent)
Zat is true, I am not used to
working in such 'orreeble
conditions.
(seeing the paintings)
Hey... Monet!
He crouches next to the paintings stacked against the wall.

JACK
Isn't he great... the use of color? I
saw him once... through a hole in this
garden fence in Giverny.
She goes into the adjoining walk-in wardrobe closet. He
sees her go to the safe and start working the combination.
He's fascinated.
ROSE
Cal insist on luggin this thing
everywhere.
JACK
Should I be expecting him anytime
soon?
ROSE
Not as long as the cigars and brandy
hold out.
CLUNK! She unlocks the safe. Glancing up, she meets his
eyes in the mirror behind the safe. She opens it and
removes the necklace, then holds it out to Jack who takes it
nervously.
JACK
What is it? A sapphire?
ROSE
A diamond. A very rare diamond,
called the Heart of the Ocean.
Jack gazes at wealth beyond his comprehension.
ROSE
I want you to draw me like your
French girl. Wearing this.
(she smiles at him)
Wearing only this.
He looks up at her, surprised, and we CUT TO:
104 ROSE'S BEDROOM. ON THE BUTTERFLY COMB as Rose draws it
out of her hair. She shakes her head and her hair falls
free around her shoulders.
105 IN THE SITTING ROOM Jack is laying out his pencils like
surgical tools. His sketchbook is open and ready. He looks
up as she comes into the room, wearing a silk kimono.

ROSE
The last thing I need is another
picture of me looking like a china
doll. As a paying customer, I
expect to get what I want.
She hands him a dime and steps back, parting the kimono.
The blue stone lies on her creamy breast. Her heart is
pounding as she slowly lowers the robe.
Jakc looks so stricken, it is almost comical. The kimono
drops to the floor (this is all in cuts, lyrical).
ROSE
Tell me when it looks right to you.
She poses on the divan, settling like a cat into the
position we remember from the drawing... almost.
JACK
Uh... just bend your left leg a
little and... and lower your head.
Eyes to me. That's it.
Jack starts to sketch. He drops his pencil and she stifles
a laugh.
ROSE
I believe you are blushing, Mr. Big
Artiste. I can't imagine Monsieur
Monet blushing.
JACK
(sweating)
He does landscapes.
TIGHT ON JACK as his eyes come up to look at her over the
top edge of his sketchpad. We have seen this image of him
before, in her memory. It is an image she will carry the
rest of her life.
Despite his nervousness, he draws with sure strokes, and
what emerges is the best thing he has ever done. Her pose
is languid, her hands beautiful, and her eyes radiate her
energy.
PUSH SLOWLY IN ON ROSE'S FACE...
