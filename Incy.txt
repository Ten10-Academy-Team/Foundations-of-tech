Itsy Bitsy spider
Climbed up the water spout
Along came the breeze and blew the spider out
code flows like rivers through the night
A dance of logic clean and clear
each function shines with hidden might
its purpose sharps, its edges near
The sun descends, a fiery ball,
A gentle breeze begins to sigh,
Shadows lengthen, covering all,
As dusk paints colours in the sky,
The day is done, beyond recall,
And peace descends as night draws nigh.
don't u just love git???
I run a test to check the speed,
The system meets the user's need.
Backups done, the files are safe,
No errors nowâ€”it's all in place.
Create a branch, begin the game,
Each line of code a spark, a flame.
Push your change, then test it well,
A Pull Request will surely tell.
