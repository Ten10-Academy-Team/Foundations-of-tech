Incy wincy spider
Climbed up the water spout

I need to clean
the bathroom grout

The great big rain 
Washed him down again!
He danced and he sang, 
And then with a bang, 
He flew in a bubble, 
And avoided all trouble!

Ubzi was here
And I dont like to shout

No the incy wincy spider doesn't
climb the water sprout

It climbed my table and scared the living daylights out!

He decided he didn't like swimming
And then he wanted out :(

Incy Wincy Spider
Climbed up the water spout 
Down came the raingit 
and washed the spider out 

I think we might have some errors in here, make a change here
