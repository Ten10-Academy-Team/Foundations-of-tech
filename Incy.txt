<<<<<<< HEAD
Itsy Bitsy spider
Climbed up the water spout
Hey diddle diddle the cat and the fiddle
=======
The sun descends, a fiery ball,
A gentle breeze begins to sigh,
Shadows lengthen, covering all,
As dusk paints colours in the sky,
The day is done, beyond recall,
And peace descends as night draws nigh.
