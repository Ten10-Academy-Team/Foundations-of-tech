Climbed up the water spout
Down came the rain
And washed poor Incy out

 Out came the sunshine
<<<<<<< HEAD
and dried up all the wrain
And Incy Wincy spider-man
Climbed up the spout again
;)

and dried up all the rain
and dried up all the wrain (rain??)
And Incy Wincy spider
Climbed up the spout again 

Repeat until everyone is sick of song

And Incy Wincy spideruhubbub
Climbed up the spout again
hello

That was a bit silly of him
to go all the way out on a limb
just to experience the pain
of being washed away again

Let's go!
