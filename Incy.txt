Academy 38 Poem
Today we all built bridges,
You would think we were here for engineering,
BO BO BO 
HIT THE ROLLY STORE WITH THE ROLLIE ON
WHAT WAS OUR GET AWAY CAR? 
JAG PORTFOLIO
I'm sitting at the top, chilling on my throne,
Top of my game, they got me on posters,
Turned to tech, ain't forgot my roots,
my bars so hot i dont need no toasters
