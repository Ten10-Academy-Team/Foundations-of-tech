Academy 38 Poem
Today we all built bridges,
You would think we were here for engineering,
BO BO BO 
HIT THE ROLLY STORE WITH THE ROLLIE ON
WHAT WAS OUR GET AWAY CAR? 
JAG PORTFOLIO

Matt is terrible at writing
He cannot rhyme
But he can push branches
He does it all the time

A bit of quality
A bit of rhyme
A bit of integrity
A bit of thyme
