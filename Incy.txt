Itsy Bitsy spider
Climbed up the water spout

code flows like rivers through the night
A dance of logic clean and clear
each function shines with hidden might
its purpose sharps, its edges near



The sun descends, a fiery ball,
A gentle breeze begins to sigh,
Shadows lengthen, covering all,
As dusk paints colours in the sky,
The day is done, beyond recall,
And peace descends as night draws nigh.
