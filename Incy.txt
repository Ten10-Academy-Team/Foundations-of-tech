The itsy bitsy spider
went up the water spout.
Down came the rain,
and washed the spider out.

and dried up all the rain.
So, the itsy bitsy spider
went up the spout again.

WE ARE GROUP 3
WE ARE GROUP 3
WE ARE GROUP 3
Make it rain

This is a lovely story

Incy Wincy loved Git so much
It Pushes, It Pulls, Commiting is it's thing.
Incy prefers Git over subversion, as it is the main one!
