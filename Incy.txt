Itsy Bitsy spider
Climbed up the water spout

Beneath the stars so soft and bright,
The moonlight dances through the night.
A breeze whispers secrets to the trees,
While dreams drift gently on the breeze.
Hearts find calm in midnightâ€™s grace,
And sleep descends with sweet embrace.

The sun descends, a fiery ball,
A gentle breeze begins to sigh,
Shadows lengthen, covering all,
As dusk paints colours in the sky,
The day is done, beyond recall,
And peace descends as night draws nigh.
