Itsy Bitsy spider
Climbed up the water spout
Down came the rain
And washed poor Incy out

Out came the sunshine
and dried up all the rain

 Out came the sunshine
and dried up all the wrain
And Incy Wincy spider-man
Climbed up the spout again

and dried up all the rain
and dried up all the wrain (rain??)
And Incy Wincy spider
Climbed up the spout again

and dried up all the wrain (rain??)
And Incy Wincy spider
Climbed up the spout again

According to all known laws of aviation, there is no way a bee should be able to fly. 
It's wings are too small to get its fat little body off the ground. 
The bee, of course, flies anyway, because bees don't care what humans think is impossible.

Look for the bare necessities
The simple bare necessities
Forget about your worries and your strife
I mean the bare necessities
Old Mother Nature's recipes
That bring the bare necessities of life



Can it please work now?

Aye, fight and you may die. Run and you'll live -- at least a while. And dying in your beds many years from now, would you be willing to trade all the days from this day to that for one chance, just one chance to come back here and tell our enemies that they may take our lives, but they'll never take our freedom!!!
